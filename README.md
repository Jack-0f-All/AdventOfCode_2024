    Brute forced pt1. Need to implement pt2 using HashMap. Attempts to utalize recursion kept overflowing memory.
--- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---
--- Day 14: Restroom Redoubt ---
    Used hint from reddit for how to determine if the drones made a tree (pt. 2). 
--- Day 15: Warehouse Woes ---
--- Day 16: Reindeer Maze ---
    Needed to do some research to find algorithim for finding shortest path. DIY method worked but was to inefficient
    but was to slow for full problem set. 

--- Day 18: RAM Run ---
    Part 1 is only concerned with the shortest number of steps to get to the end. Should be able to reuse algorithm from previous Day.

--- Day 25: Code Chronicle ---
    Utalized a new concept for me, byte masking, because I was initially concerned with runtime for this puzzle. In retrospect I'm not sure if runtime would have really been an issue, but implementing the new concept was interesting.
